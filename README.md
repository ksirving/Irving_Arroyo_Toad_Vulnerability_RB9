# Irving_Arroyo_Toad_Vulnerability_RB9

assessing the vulnerability of arroyo toad in response to climate-induced flow changes

## 00_gridded_200m_data_format.R

formats remote sensing data into 22m grid resolution
combines with flow, aoil and landscape data
all data output as raster files

output - 

00_all_rasters_200m.tif

*note that these are un snapped points

## 01_toad_observations.R

formats and combines all toad observations
make everything spatial and uses NHDPlus tools to get COMIDs for observation points

output - 
01_toad_obs_points_RB9.shp

## 02_auto_gridded_model_no_climate.R

runs the RF models included pseudo absences
coeficients
variable importance
partial plots and direction of relationships


## 03_predictions_current.R

predictions under current conditions

creates figure of observations and predictions

## 04_comids.R

gets and checks comids that are missing - can ignore this one

## 05_future predictions.R

predicts probability of occurrence under future flow scenarios
creates some boxplots for comparison
takes along time to run

## 06_model_comparison.R

comparing models with Treglia et al 2015 - not needed anymore

## 07_physcial_factors_of_predictions.R

calculates summary stats for ffm, elevation. t tests on ffm comparing to baseline
counts occurences and stats on protected land and critical habitat
